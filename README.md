# PC-SPRINT

The PC-SPRINT is a PC accelerator board design released by Doug Severson in 1985 and published in computer magazines of the time. It is designed to allow overclocking of an [Intel 8088](Datasheets/Intel 8088 Datasheet.pdf)-based computer such as the IBM 5150 / 5160 PCs, PCjr, Tandy 1000, and I'm sure a whole lot more.

In the case of the IBM 5150, the system clock is generated by a 14.318MHz crystal connected to an [Intel 8284A](Datasheets/Intel 8284A-1 Datasheet.pdf) Clock Generator Driver. The 8284A divides the crystal's signal by 3, giving us our 4.77MHz clock. Unfortunately we can't just replace the crystal on the motherboard, as this would play havoc with all sorts of things. The basis of this accelerator is to provide a new, faster crystal to generate a clock signal that will be used exclusively by the CPU. The PC-SPRINT also adds a "Turbo" switch as found on later PCs to enable / disable the higher clock rate and a hardware reset button, which is lacking on the IBM 5150.

When used with the recommended 22.11MHz crystal, the CPU will run at a clock speed of 7.37MHz. Note that in order to utilise this accelerator, the original 4.77MHz 8088 CPU must be replaced with either a higher clocked version (e.g. 8088-2) or equivalent (e.g. NEC V20).

Note that some files have PDF conversions which were included with the version of the package as received by myself, so I have also linked those above.

The author was keen to include the original unmodified package of files with future revisions, so it is available in [pcsprint_1985.zip](pcsprint_1985.zip).

The original  design was released under a license analogous to the modern-day GPL, so I have attached that license here. The PC-SPRINT is therefore assumed to comply with the [Open Hardware Specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware).
