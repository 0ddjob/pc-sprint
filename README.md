# PC-SPRINT

The PC-SPRINT is a PC accelerator board design released by Doug Severson in 1985 and published in computer magazines of the time. It is designed to allow overclocking of an 8088-based computer such as the IBM 5150 / 5160 PCs, PCjr, Tandy 1000, and I'm sure a whole lot more.

This design was released under a license analogous to the modern-day GPL, so I have attached that license here.

Note that some files have PDF conversions which were included with the version of the package as received by myself, so I have also linked those above.

The author was keen to include the original unmodified package of files with future revisions, so it is available in [pcsprint_1985.zip](pcsprint_1985.zip).
